`{codespacer}` will install the necessary files to support Github Codespaces 
running an RStudio session.

This package is mostly just an aide-memoire for me - especially if I need to setup
a rstudio codespace in a hurry.

## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/codespacer) with:

``` r
# install.package('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/codespacer')
```

## Install codespaces files in your package


```{r example, eval = FALSE}
# setwd(root-directory-of-your-package)
library(codespacer)
install_codespace_files()
# git add .devcontainer
# git commit -m "add codespace files" .devcontainer
# git push
```


## Launch a codespace in this repository

* Go the package repository on github
* `Code` -> `Codespaces` -> `Create a new codespace on main`
    * See Screenshot 1 below
* Wait for machine to build and start (first startup is slow. subsequent startups are faster)
* Select `ports` -> `Rstudio 8787` -> `Open in browser`
    * See Screenshot 2 below
* Login to Rstudio:  user = `rstudio`, pass = `rstudio`
